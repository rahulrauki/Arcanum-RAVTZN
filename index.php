    <h1>Arcanum-RAVTZN</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the place where you could exercise your skills of problem solving and analysing but most importantly having fun. And thanks for registering to the event.</p>

    <p class="instructions">Instructions</p>
    <p class="second">Take your time (not too much..) and read it completely</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To start with, this website is perfectly safe to use. It runs on a private server in our PC and it is being hosted temporarily for the event. We use a service called "Ngrok" <a href="https://ngrok.com/product" target="_blank">Click here to learn about it.</a></li>
      <li>Using a PC for the event is highly recommeded as the website is coded in desktop-first format. This makes it hard for the mobile users, we had to use this owing to a particular round in the event.</li>
      <li>During the event you will the guided and provided with resources adequately. But not all are provided, you have to guess and go with it sometimes to make the event more fun.</li>
      <li>The event has several puzzles for you to solve, and if you are a freaky genius good for you. But if you are the regular kid like everyone. Dont be intimidated by the questions, do your best.</li>
      <li>No worries if you cant complete the event within the time. You will be provided with points for each question you complete. Redeem your points by showing us the stage in which you are in.</li>
      <li>If there are any forms that ask you to submit your team names, its for our reference to note the timestamp and decide the winners. So if you ever see a form asking for the team name fill it ASAP.</li>
      <li>If you are team of 2 then while filling the form, any one of you could fill and submit your team name or anything that identifies you. This makes keeping track easy for us.</li>
      <li>As mentioned above, this runs on a private server whose bandwith is limited to a few at a time. So incase if you are in teams of two, using just one device will help in case if any problems occur.</li>
      <li>Finally even though the website can remember your answers it is safe to note them down seperately in a rough paper for backup. Just in case of any technical faults.</li>
    </ul>
